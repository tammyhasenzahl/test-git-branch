CRLF injection vulnerabilities occur when data enters an application from an untrusted source and is not properly validated before being used.  For example, if an attacker is able to inject a CRLF into a log file, he could append falsified log entries, thereby misleading administrators or cover traces of the attack.  If an attacker is able to inject CRLFs into an HTTP response header, he can use this ability to carry out other attacks such as cache poisoning.

In particular, storing passwords in plaintext or hard-coding passwords directly into application code are design issues that cannot be easily remedied.  Not only does embedding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult.  Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software.  If a hard-coded password is compromised in a commercial product, all deployed instances may be vulnerable to attack, putting customers at risk."/>

For example, instead of storing the word &quot;secret,&quot; the application stores an MD5 hash of the word.
